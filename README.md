Iris Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors
This repository contains a Python script for classifying Iris flowers using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. The dataset used for this classification is the Iris dataset from scikit-learn.


The script demonstrates the use of K-Nearest Neighbors for classifying Iris flowers into different species based on their features. It uses the KNeighborsClassifier from scikit-learn for training and predicting.

Dataset
The dataset used is the popular Iris dataset, which is included in scikit-learn. The features include sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Model Training and Evaluation
The script splits the dataset into training and testing sets, fits the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier on the training data, and evaluates the model on the testing data. The accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix are printed to the console.

Requirements: Python 3.x, scikit-learn,numpy
